- `DataMarketplace`: Core marketplace functionality
- `PrivacyLayer`: Data access control and encryption

### 3. Verification Network
- Distributed verification nodes
- Quality assessment system
- Consensus mechanism
- Node reputation tracking

### 4. Storage System
- Decentralized data storage
- End-to-end encryption
- Access control management
- Data indexing and search

### 5. Rewards System
- Token distribution
- Reputation scoring
- Achievement system
- Challenge campaigns

### 6. Analytics Dashboard
- Market metrics
- Quality insights
- Token economics
- User engagement tracking
